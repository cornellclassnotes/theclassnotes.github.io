The Class Notes have sung at many different events in many different countries. We have
toured the US extensively and have performed at weddings, primary and secondary schools,
colleges, business functions, and at major events such as the 1999 Christmas Tree Lighting
at Rockefeller Center in New York City. Add a touch of class to your next event!
