One of our recently recorded covers, *Best Thing I Never Had* (Maya Gunaseharan, soloist), was selected for [Voices Only 2012](http://www.voicesonlyacappella.com/VO/vo2012.php)! We are thrilled and honored to have been chosen for this annual a cappella compilation. Many thanks to our recording engineer, Ben Lieberman, and Liquid 5th for the editing, mixing and mastering. You guys rock!
