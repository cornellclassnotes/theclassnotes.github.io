It's the group that pioneered the co-ed a cappella landscape and became a cultural
phenomenon - the Class Notes are back with an all-new repertoire!

In three weeks, share the love - get hooked on the feeling - and get ready to cheer for
the underdogs! Cuttin' Class XXVI is April 23; we hope to see you there!
