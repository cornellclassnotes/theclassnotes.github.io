Our Fall concert, **CLASSIFIED 2012**, is quickly approaching! On **NOV. 9, 2012**, have your socks knocked off by the suave sound of the classiest Cornellians on campus: THE CLASS NOTES! Tickets are $7 in advance and $10 at the door â€” but buy quickly! Tickets to this once-in-a-lifetime event are selling out rapidly.

Email gm@theclassnotes.com for tickets, talk to your favourite Class Note, or grab the advance ticket from the comfort of your own home on CampusAmp!
