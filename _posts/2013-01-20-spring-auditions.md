New semester, new Notes! The Class Notes are holding open auditions for all voice parts and class years at these times and locations:

* Wednesday, 1/30: 7 - 10 pm in Lincoln Hall, room B08

For the audition, please prepare a 30 second solo that showcases your voice. The rest of the audition will consist of a quick bit of range testing and pitch matching.
