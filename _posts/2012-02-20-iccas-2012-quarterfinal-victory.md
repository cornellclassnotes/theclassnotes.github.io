We are incredibly pleased to announce that the Cornell Class Notes have won **1st place**
in the 2012 ICCA Mid-Atlantic Quarterfinals at Cornell University! The energy in Call
Auditorium last night was electric, and we'd like to thank everyone who came out to
support us. In addition to the rush of placing 1st, we'd also like to point out the
individuals who also won some very special awards.

* Maya Gunaseharan: Best Soloist
* Alex Martino: Best Vocal Percussion

We feel so priveledged to have been selected to move on from a pool of truly phenomenal
talent, and hope to represent Cornell well at the ICCA Mid-Atlantic Semi-Finals at Rutgers
University.
