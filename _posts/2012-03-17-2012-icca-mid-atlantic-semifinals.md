We had a great time at ICCA Semifinals at Rutgers this past weekend. Many thanks to Mark
McCarthy for helping us out with hotel rooms, our host group Deep Treble for getting us
where we needed on time, the Gunaseharan family for hosting us overnight and treating us
to a delicious breakfast, and obviously our extremely dedicated alumni for coming out to
support us. Congratulations to the three placing groups, and best of luck to the
Pennharmonics as they travel to compete in the finals in NYC on April 28th.
